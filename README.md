# Blogzic

My first project that i ve made using Python and Flask!


I ve made a logic from the scratch, helping myself with the book of Miguel Grinberg.
Since role model for this blog was Corey Schafer's blog, i ve also looked a bit in his code while making this project.


Users are able to create posts and comment and like other people's posts. They also have an option to follow other users and to view the posts just from these.
Users also can change the profile information, upload profile picture, change password, ask for a new one and delete everything except from their account, but this feature will be added aswell.
I also wrote down from scratch migrations, testing coverages, email sending, picture uploading and adjusting.
