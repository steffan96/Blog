# Blog

Blog project was my first programming project that I have decided to make from scratch and make it production ready. After working on Python syntax and basic programming problems and tasks, I picked up Miguel Grinberg’s Flask Web Development and went through it. In the meantime I was watching Corey Schafer’s Flask series on Youtube, and decided to make a clone of it, helping myself with the book regarding code and with the design of Corey’s project.
This project allow users to register, login and confirm their accounts via email that they receive immediately after registration. It allows users to update profil, change and reset password, change profile informations, picture, and create blog posts that are being displayed on the home page. They can also like and comment other people’s posts.

This project is covered by tests for about 40%. I have used unittest framework. I have also added a test coverage functionality, aswell as migrations. I have used Postgres as a database and have deployed it successfully to Heroku.

There was not a lot of focus on CSS since I ve picked up Flask just to get known with the framework’s functionalities, so that I can easier start with Django.
